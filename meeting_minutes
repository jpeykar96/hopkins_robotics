-   Jordan brought up the idea of using Ghost or wordpress for the website if we want to keep it simple and have very basic functionality.

-   Deciding what javascript framework to use: Leaning towards meteor.js if we can get MongoDB database
    Otherwise we want to use Node.js or find another java script framework.

-   Splitting the responsibilities: Jordan will do backend/frontend, Jason will do frontend.

-   Components of website:
    
    Each page will have a tab: Home | current projects | events | email registration (add yourself to mailing list) | Gallery (?)
    Or a menu containing all these items. 

    Homepage will be *pretty*. We're thinking a bootstrap style, vertically rolling page that highlights things about the robotics club. 

    The current projects page will have a list of all the projects members are working on. There will be a link to the project leader, the members of the project,
    description, and some pictures if they have a prototype. The projects will be split between current and complete.

    Events lists all the events the robotics club is having along with the weekly meeting times. Although the meeting times should be on the home page as well.

    Email registration will let interested members add themselves to the mailing list. 

    A gallery is just for fun

-   ToDo:
    Decide what frameworks to use.
    Set up our working environments. 
    Learn the frameworks/languages we will use
    Make a prototype
